What does Math.random() do?

Your answer: Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1 (not inclusive of 1). 
The MDN definition: The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, 
with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed 
to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.
